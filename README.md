# Student Management Database

This repository contains two main branches, each implementing a different database migration approach:

1. **EF Code-First (Change-Based Migrations)** – Uses Entity Framework Core to manage schema changes through incremental migrations.
2. **State-Based Migrations** – Manages database schema using full SQL scripts to reflect the current state of the database.

Each approach has its own documentation available in the respective branch's `README.md` file.
